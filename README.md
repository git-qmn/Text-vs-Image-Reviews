# Evaluating the Impact of Text-Based and Image-Enhanced Reviews on Consumer Purchase Intent

## Overview
This project explores how the format of online product reviews—text-only versus image-enhanced—affects consumer purchase intent. Using a randomized controlled experiment, the study investigates whether adding images to reviews significantly increases consumers' likelihood of purchasing products. While some research suggests that images can increase trust and engagement, our findings show that product familiarity is a more important driver of purchase intent than review format.

## Course Information
- **Course**: BA830 - Business Experimentation and Causal Methods, Boston University  
- **Team Members**: Hui Gao, Hyunjin (Jin) Yu, Quan Nguyen, Wei-An (Vivian) Huang

## Dataset & Experimental Design
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
- **Control Group**: Viewed reviews with text only.
- **Treatment Group**: Viewed reviews with both text and images.

Each participant evaluated multiple products (from Amazon Best-Sellers) across different categories. Key covariates such as product familiarity, purchase experience, and gender were controlled to ensure balanced comparisons.

## Key Variables
- **Independent Variable**: Review format (Text vs. Text + Image)
- **Dependent Variable**: Purchase likelihood (1–10 scale)
- **Covariates**: Product familiarity, purchase experience, gender

## Methodology
- **OLS Regression**: Assessed the effect of review format on purchase likelihood
- **Cohen’s D**: Estimated effect size across product types
- **Balance Test**: Validated the randomization of covariates
- **Interaction Analysis**: Checked for differential impacts across product categories

## Findings
- Review format (text vs. image) was **not statistically significant** in predicting purchase likelihood.
- **Product familiarity** had a strong positive effect on purchase intent.
- **Gender** showed slight imbalance between groups but had no significant impact.
- Across six product categories, review format did not consistently affect consumer behavior.

## Managerial Implications
- Businesses should focus more on **enhancing product familiarity** (e.g., verified purchases, detailed descriptions) rather than relying on images in reviews.
- **Review strategies** should be tailored by product type—images may help with low-involvement items but have limited impact overall.

## Limitations
- Small sample size reduced statistical power.
- Controlled survey may not reflect real-world shopping behavior.
- Imbalances in gender and unobserved factors could affect results.
